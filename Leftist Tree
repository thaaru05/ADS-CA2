# 1) Get Min:       O(1)      [same as both Binary and Binomial]
# 2) Delete Min:    O(Log n)  [same as both Binary and Binomial]
# 3) Insert:        O(Log n)  [O(Log n) in Binary and O(1) in Binomial and O(Log n) for worst case]                                                                  
# 4) Merge:         O(Log n)  [O(Log n) in Binomial]
